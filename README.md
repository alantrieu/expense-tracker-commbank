# Description
Short project to apply basic React, Javascript and CSS programming skills gained from [Maximilian Schwarzmuller's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

Idea was loosely based on Commonwealth Bank's monthly cash flow and spend categories features.
